Court Simulation with DAG Execution
===================================

Simulates a courtroom trial with 4 agents:
- Witness (user input)
- Defense Attorney
- Prosecution Attorney 
- Judge
- Jury

Data flows from witness testimony to all agents, then lawyers present arguments
to judge and jury for final verdict.
