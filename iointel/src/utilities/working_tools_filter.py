Working Tools Filter for WorkflowPlanner

This module provides a curated list of tools that are known to work properly
with the WorkflowPlanner, filtering out problematic tools that cause pydantic_ai
issues or other compatibility problems.

Based on testing with Llama models, these tools have been verified to work.
